# Attendance Management system Using Face Recognition

This project involves building an attendance system which utilizes facial recognition to mark the presence, time-in of employees. It covers areas such as facial detection, alignment, and recognition, along with the development of a web application to cater to various use cases of the system. 
This project intends to serve as an efficient substitute for traditional manual attendance systems.
It can be used in corporate offices, schools, and organizations where security is essential.
This project aims to automate the traditional attendance system where the attendance is marked manually.


It will enables an organization to maintain its records like in-time, out time, break time and attendance digitally. Digitalization of the system would also help in better visualization of the data using graphs to display the no. of employees present today, total work hours of each employee and their break time. Its added features serve as an efficient upgrade and replacement over the traditional attendance system.
